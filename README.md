## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### What is the difference with org-bullets?

The `org-ibullets` package is based on the [MELPA org-bullets fork](https://github.com/integral-dw/org-bullets), which in turn is derived from the unmaintained [org-bullets](https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets).

Here are the improvements `org-ibullets`:
- **Optimizations (faster)**: `org-ibullets` has been optimized to eliminate redundant computations, such as repeated calls to functions like `(match-end 0)`. This reduction in unnecessary processing enhances performance, particularly in larger documents.
- **No syntax warnings**: Unlike `org-bullets`, which may generate syntax or font-lock warnings in certain Emacs configurations, `org-ibullets` resolves these issues, providing a smoother user experience.
- **Various enhancements**: Included `-*- lexical-binding: t; -*-`, improved readability and reduced redundancy, fixed warnings, added Melpazoid tests, implemented additional tests, and resolved fontification issues.

This revision improves clarity and flow while maintaining the original meaning.

### How can I further improve its speed?

I recommend adding the following to your Emacs init:
```emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)
```

This variable also holds further information regarding what I believe is the cause of the problem.

## Alternatives

- [org-superstar](https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode): A more complex alternative to `org-ibullets` that offers additional features beyond showing bullets as UTF-8 characters. **In contrast, org-ibullets is lightweight and focused on a single task.**
